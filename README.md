## Project Info

This ia a responsive mobile friendly blog post website.
The project only uses HTML5 and CSS3 programs due to the requirements.
This is my first website that I created independently according to a request in the project proposal.

## Required Skills and Technologies
The project required only to utilize HTML and CSS skills to build a personal blog website, including custom images, layout and styling. Along with webpage design considerations, students had to appropriately structure the files, as well as use proper CSS and HTML formatting and style (i.e. all code is lowercase, it does not have trailing white spaces, indentation is consistent, etc.). Pages had to be made mobile-friendly and work correctly on all display sizes.
